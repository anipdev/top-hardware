This project is a simple CRUD API application built with Go (Golang), for managing inventory at a hardware store.  
The program allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on product data such as name, price, and stock quantity.  
Currently, the application is not connected to a database, and the data is temporarily stored in the backend.
